# TapEat UGAHACK5
I worked on the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this project. I created and designed the restaurant menu for "Azteca" using HTML and CSS and used JavaScript to enhance user experience by adding the "Add to Meal" buttons. Not only did this project help me improve my skills as a developer, but also allowed me to gain more experience with purpose built applications.
